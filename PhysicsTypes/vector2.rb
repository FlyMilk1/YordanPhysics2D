# Represents a 2D vector with x and y components.

# Provides operations for vector arithmetic including addition, subtraction,
# multiplication, and division. Supports both vector-to-vector operations and
# scalar operations. All non-mutating operations return new Vector2 instances,
# while mutating operations modify the instance in-place.
